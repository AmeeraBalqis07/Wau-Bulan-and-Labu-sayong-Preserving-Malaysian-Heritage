            <br>
            <p  style="text-align: justify">The traditional Malaysian kite known as Wau Bulan has been in use for hundreds of years. Wau Bulan believed 
                to have been around since the fifteenth century. Some people claim that kites imported through trade from China and other nations had an impact.</p>
                <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">Wau Bulan has a well-known story that connects it to the ancient Srivijaya Empire. According to legend, the regions 
                that a prince named Dewa Muda conquered were symbolized by a huge kite. He expanded the kite by adding more pieces as he seized more territory, 
                making it larger and more significant.</p>
                <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The Arabic letter "و" (which resembles the shape of the kite) or the sound the kite makes in the wind (which sounds like 
                "wau… wau…") could be the source of the name "Wau."</p>
                <br>
             <p style="text-align: justify">Wau Bulan used to be used for more than just amusement.  It was used by farmers to frighten birds away from rice fields 
                or to soothe kids while they worked by making a humming noise.  Wau Bulan has become a proud representation of Malaysian culture.  It can be found 
                on currency, coins, and even traditional songs.  Beautifully adorned and expertly crafted, Wau Bulan continues to be adored and flown at festivals 
                both domestically and internationally.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center"><strong>THE HISTORY OF LABU SAYONG</strong></h1>
            <br>
            <div class="history-wau-bulan">
            <h3 class="header-color"><strong>Background of Labu Sayong</strong></h3>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The Sayong village in Perak, Malaysia, is the origin of the traditional water pitcher known as Labu Sayong.
                Its name literally translates to "gourd pitcher," as the original iterations were actually dehydrated gourds.  The locals later started 
                molding these clay containers, maintaining their rounded form.  Because of the type of clay and the way it is made, Labu Sayong is unique 
                in that it naturally cools drinking water, even during hot weather.</p>
                <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">Labu Sayong have begun in the early 1800s when a talented craftsman named Tuk Muluk (or Tuk Kaluk) brought 
                pottery-making to the locals from Sumatra. He made Kampung Kepala Bendang his home and taught the locals how to make metal tools and pottery.
                As time passed, the women in the area developed their skills in hand-shaping clay, polishing it with smooth stones, and firing it in traditional furnaces.
                The deep black color of the pots was achieved by smoking them with rice husks after they were fired.</p>
                <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">An expert in Japanese ceramics who worked with SIRIM in 1986 presented a novel mold-based technique known as labu acu.
                As a result, Labu Sayong could be produced in greater quantities and faster. Although this made the craft more accessible and helped preserve it,
                some felt that the original designs' traditional, handmade value was diminished.</p>
                <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">These days, Labu Sayong is a representation of Malay heritage as well as a practical object.  It is still produced
                and marketed in Sayong and the neighboring areas, where some people buy it for functional purposes and others as trinkets or decorations.
                Kampung Kepala Bendang even has a museum that teaches people how to make Labu Sayong and displays this heritage.  The rich cultural heritage 
                of Malaysia and the craftsmanship of its traditional craftsmen are still embodied in this exquisite black clay jug.</p>
